# Task Prompt 

> 🧠 Day 2 Task: “Reverse-Engineer Something Cool”
> 
> Objective: Strengthen your understanding of how real projects tick.
> 
> Task:
> 
> Pick one small open-source project on GitHub — something that interests you (a Unity tool, an Unreal plugin, a simple web app, anything).
> 
> Clone or download it.
> 
> Spend 30 minutes exploring the structure: folders, naming conventions, dependencies, and how the main logic flows.
> 
> Write a short note to yourself (or a markdown file in your new repo) summarizing:
> 
> What the project does
> 
> One thing you learned from how it’s built
> 
> One thing you would do differently if you made it yourself
> 
> Why this matters:
> Reverse-engineering teaches you design intuition — how good developers make decisions about structure, performance, and clarity. It’s the “study great works” phase of the coding arts.
> 
> Bonus:
> If the project inspires you, star it or open a small issue/comment to say what you liked. That’s your first gentle footprint in the open-source world.
