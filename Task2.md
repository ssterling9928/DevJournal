# Task Prompt 

> 🧠 Day 2 Task: “Reverse-Engineer Something Cool”
> 
> Objective: Strengthen your understanding of how real projects tick.
> 
> Task:
> 
> Pick one small open-source project on GitHub — something that interests you (a Unity tool, an Unreal plugin, a simple web app, anything).
> 
> Clone or download it.
> 
> Spend 30 minutes exploring the structure: folders, naming conventions, dependencies, and how the main logic flows.
> 
> Write a short note to yourself (or a markdown file in your new repo) summarizing:
> 
> What the project does
> 
> One thing you learned from how it’s built
> 
> One thing you would do differently if you made it yourself
> 
> Why this matters:
> Reverse-engineering teaches you design intuition — how good developers make decisions about structure, performance, and clarity. It’s the “study great works” phase of the coding arts.
> 
> Bonus:
> If the project inspires you, star it or open a small issue/comment to say what you liked. That’s your first gentle footprint in the open-source world.
>

💭💭🤔

This was actually a really fun task.  I have never really just picked a project at random, downloaded it, and then inspected it, just for the fun of it.  I ended up searching *"web game"* on GitHub, and scrolled until I seen one I liked.  I decided fork my own version of the following repo. 

[View Repo Here](https://github.com/kunjgit/GameZone) <br>
[Repo Website](https://kunjgit.github.io/GameZone/)

So basically this is a website that hosts hundreds of simple javascript web games.  It was actually fun scrolling through the vast collection that it hosted.  I also tried multiple games myself.  What I found was that alot of the games I tried, were not playable, or just lacked common game flow.  For example, some games had completely repetitive goals, with no score, or no way to win or lose.  Some games had the preview images broken, for example, Yathzee seemed responsive and intuitive, but the dice were missing the images which made the game unplayable.  With this being said, these are very minor, and possibly just outdated errors that could easily be fixed.  I still found the repo as a whole to be very interesting, as many people have contributed their own games, and its not just one developer.  I was thinking about creating a Pull Request and including my game from my website.  

One thing that I liked about this project was that it was completely organized and I was able to easily and quickly find everything I needed to vizualize how this was put together.  I did find in a few games that some developers had just one of each file type.  In small cases, that could be fine, however, some of the javascript files that I was reading were several hundred lines of code.  At this point, that is one main thing that I would do differently.  I would absolutely split up these one files, into multiple files.  Not only does it make much simplier for coding and organization, it is typically always best practice to use that style of coding.  Another thing I would change, if I had designed it, would have to be the main page's color.  I feel that its a bit too over the top.  It has a lot of flashy neon colors, too much animation going on, and depending on the background color, the text may be difficult to see.  I feel that is a major design flaw.  I would darken it up for a more modern look, and take out some of the action going on.  

In summary this was a very fun task for the day.  It helped me see a little more on how others develop their own games and projects.  I found myself thinking about all the things that I could do differently, which I feel is a great way to think about development.  Always looking and thinking... ***"How can I make this better?"***
