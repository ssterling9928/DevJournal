> 
> 🧭 Task:

> 	1.	Your Portfolio Website: Add or tweak one small section — maybe a “Featured Project” card with screenshots, or a personal tagline that better shows your vibe.
> 	2.	Your GitHub Profile: Update your README, pin your top 3 repos, or write a one-line description for each project so it’s recruiter-friendly.

I decided to completely revamp my GitHub profile.  I am extremely happy with the final result.  I was able to follow the look of some of my other READMEs in other repos, matching the design layouts and making it look much more organized and flowing collectively.  I also added some slight animation and flair to my profile.  Check out the major differences below!!

Also be sure to see everything work live on my profile page! <br>
