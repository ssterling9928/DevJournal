## About this Project

*My personal dev journal.*


The idea behind this repository is for me to complete tasks related to development or career building, to be able to keep my skills sharp and my learning on track.  This will basically be my posting grounds for everything related to these tasks, or personal projects that I may be working on as well.  Feel free to collaborate along the way, do the tasks your own way, and share how you made it different.
