# Response

Ok, so I ended up stretching this one out way longer than an hour, hence the major delay. I haven't worked a whole lot on API calls,
so this was a fun and challenging *"quick"* project.  

I decided to do a quick Weather API project.  I am able to input my City and State, and get basic weather conditions.  Then it prints it 
to a nice formatted console. 

I created it's own repository due to it being multiple files.

Note: This project is used for Task 5 too.
