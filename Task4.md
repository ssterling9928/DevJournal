## Task Prompt 

> Day 4 Task: “API Arcade!” 🎮
>
> Mission Brief:
> Today’s adventure is all about leveling up your backend and integration skills — something every great dev needs in their toolkit.
> 
> 🧭 Task:
> In about an hour, build a tiny app or script that fetches and displays data from a public API.
> Pick something fun — like:
> 
> 🐱 Cat facts API (https://catfact.ninja/fact)
> 
> 🌤️ OpenWeather API (for your city)
> 
> 🎥 Movie quotes, Pokémon, or space photos — whatever sparks joy!
> 
> You can use JavaScript, Python, or any language you’re comfortable with. Keep it simple: fetch data, print or display it, done!
> 
> 🎯 Goal:
> Show you can talk to external data sources — a key skill for junior devs and a solid project to show off later.
> 
> 💡 Bonus XP:
> Push your mini project to GitHub with a short README that explains:
> 
> What it does
> What API you used
> How to run it
> That’s a tidy, resume-ready portfolio addition. 🧠💼
> 
> Now go forth, API adventurer! ⚔️ Your data-fetching skills await sharpening.
